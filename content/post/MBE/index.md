## My career

My participation in the master’s degree in Management of the Built Environment at the Politecnico di Milano was driven by a strong desire to expand my knowledge in the field of Real Estate. From the beginning, I had a solid academic and working background in architectural design, but I have always had a deep passion for **ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL** topics as well. The union of these two disciplines has always fascinated me.

During my academic career, I decided to dedicate myself to personal projects that allowed me to apply the techniques and knowledge learned over the years. I have worked on several initiatives aimed at the creative and innovative use of the skills acquired in **REAL ESTATE**. These projects gave me the opportunity to put theories into practice and to face real challenges in the field of Real Estate.

In addition, I have always tried to enrich my personal training through a series of in-depth readings. My passion for the topic has led me to constantly study and inform myself about the latest trends and developments in the industry. I am convinced that academic excellence goes hand in hand with personal improvement, and I have devoted time and energy to achieving both.

Participating in the Master’s degree in Management of the Built Environment provided me with an ideal platform to deepen my interests in the field of Real Estate, **combining architectural skills with a solid understanding of economic and financial aspects**. This path has given me a holistic view of real estate and has prepared me for the challenges and opportunities that the market presents.
