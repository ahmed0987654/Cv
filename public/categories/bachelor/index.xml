&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-career&#34;&gt;My career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to pursue a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Architecture Design at &lt;strong&gt;Politecnico di Milano&lt;/strong&gt; due to my deep love and passion for architecture, planning, attention to detail, and creative thinking. The program offered by Politecnico di Milano perfectly aligned with my interests and goals in the field of architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects that drew me to the field of architecture is the opportunity to create meaningful and impactful spaces that can positively influence people&amp;rsquo;s lives. I have always been fascinated by the power of architecture to shape communities, evoke emotions, and contribute to the overall well-being of individuals. The ability to transform abstract ideas into tangible, functional structures and environments is something that truly inspires me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, my &lt;strong&gt;attention to detail&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;meticulous nature&lt;/strong&gt; find a perfect outlet in the field of architecture. I have a strong inclination towards precision and ensuring that every aspect of a design is carefully considered and executed. From the selection of materials to the arrangement of spaces, I am driven by the pursuit of excellence and strive to create designs that are not only visually stunning but also functional and practical.&lt;/p&gt;
