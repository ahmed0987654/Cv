&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-career&#34;&gt;My career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My participation in the master’s degree in Management of the Built Environment at the Politecnico di Milano was driven by a strong desire to expand my knowledge in the field of Real Estate. From the beginning, I had a solid academic and working background in architectural design, but I have always had a deep passion for &lt;strong&gt;ECONOMIC-FINANCIAL&lt;/strong&gt; topics as well. The union of these two disciplines has always fascinated me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my academic career, I decided to dedicate myself to personal projects that allowed me to apply the techniques and knowledge learned over the years. I have worked on several initiatives aimed at the creative and innovative use of the skills acquired in &lt;strong&gt;REAL ESTATE&lt;/strong&gt;. These projects gave me the opportunity to put theories into practice and to face real challenges in the field of Real Estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I have always tried to enrich my personal training through a series of in-depth readings. My passion for the topic has led me to constantly study and inform myself about the latest trends and developments in the industry. I am convinced that academic excellence goes hand in hand with personal improvement, and I have devoted time and energy to achieving both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participating in the Master’s degree in Management of the Built Environment provided me with an ideal platform to deepen my interests in the field of Real Estate, &lt;strong&gt;combining architectural skills with a solid understanding of economic and financial aspects&lt;/strong&gt;. This path has given me a holistic view of real estate and has prepared me for the challenges and opportunities that the market presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-career&#34;&gt;My career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to pursue a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Architecture Design at &lt;strong&gt;Politecnico di Milano&lt;/strong&gt; due to my deep love and passion for architecture, planning, attention to detail, and creative thinking. The program offered by Politecnico di Milano perfectly aligned with my interests and goals in the field of architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the aspects that drew me to the field of architecture is the opportunity to create meaningful and impactful spaces that can positively influence people&amp;rsquo;s lives. I have always been fascinated by the power of architecture to shape communities, evoke emotions, and contribute to the overall well-being of individuals. The ability to transform abstract ideas into tangible, functional structures and environments is something that truly inspires me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, my &lt;strong&gt;attention to detail&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;meticulous nature&lt;/strong&gt; find a perfect outlet in the field of architecture. I have a strong inclination towards precision and ensuring that every aspect of a design is carefully considered and executed. From the selection of materials to the arrangement of spaces, I am driven by the pursuit of excellence and strive to create designs that are not only visually stunning but also functional and practical.&lt;/p&gt;
